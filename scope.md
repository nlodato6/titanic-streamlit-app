I am going to get you to focus on data. The task is to create a streamlit app to display the titanic machine learning dataset from kaggle. 

All you have to do is download the titanic data and generate a streamlit app to talk to me about what the data is and looks like. 

Show me some sort of plots for it.

### Things to consider. 
1. I want a README before you tell me your are done. 
2. I want a good gitignore.
    - Your github cannot include a "pycache/"
3. I want the code linted (pylint)
4. I want 3 pages on this streamlit app. (The first page cannot be jumping into the data - think "Splash page")
5. I want you to NOT use Object Oriented programming. (We arent there yet)
6. I want every function to have docstrings. ---NUMPY STYLE
7. I want you to use anything but a default theme in streamlit (not light or dark - I want unique colors)
8. Your "app.py" should be no more than 30 lines of code. 


- I want you to code this out in feature branches and when you merge, I want to see pull requests. I will only ever judge what you put in main/master.
- I also want you to tag version control for any commit merged in the main/master branch (git tag v1.0.0 git push)
